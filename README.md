# Northcoders News API

Instructions:
To use this project:
- Create two new files in the main project folder, ".env.test" and ".env.development".
- In the ".env.test" file, add only the line : "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test;" 
- In the ".env.development" file, add only the line : "PGDATABASE=nc_news_development;" 
- This will assign the correct databases required for the test and development folders so any changes on either do not affect the other.
- Run "npm install" to install the Husky package if desired.
